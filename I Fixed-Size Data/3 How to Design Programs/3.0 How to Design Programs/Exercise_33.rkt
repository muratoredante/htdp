; The year 2000 problem refers to potential computer errors related to
; the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates in and after the year 2000.

; Many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits,
; making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.
; Computer systems' inability to distinguish dates correctly had the potential to bring down worldwide
; infrastructures for computer reliant industries.

; Contrary to published expectations, few major errors occurred in 2000. Supporters of the Y2K remediation effort argued
; that this was primarily due to the pre-emptive action of many computer programmers and information technology experts.
